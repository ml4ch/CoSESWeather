# Welcome to CoSESWeather

In this project a Weather-Data Acquisition and Management System has been developed. In this system an Arduino-based microcontorller (client) interfaces different kinds of sensors and forms the core entity of the weather-station developed throughout this project. 
Acquired data is then forwarded to a RaspberryPi-based device (server) where data is processed and permanently stored in MySQL databases.
A GUI-Application (CoSESWeatherApp) has been developed to enable users to conveniently interact with the system (weather-data export, account management, system commands etc.).
